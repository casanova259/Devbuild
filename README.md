## 🎯 About The Project

**ReUnion** is a comprehensive alumni management system designed to bridge the gap between educational institutions, their alumni, and current students. We transform scattered, disconnected alumni data into a thriving, engaged community.

### Why ReUnion?

Most educational institutions struggle with:
- 📊 **Fragmented Data**: Alumni information scattered across WhatsApp groups, emails, and spreadsheets
- 🔗 **Weak Connections**: No structured way for alumni and students to interact
- 💼 **Missed Opportunities**: Lost potential for mentorship, internships, and job placements
- 📅 **Event Chaos**: Difficult to organize and track alumni events
- 💰 **Fundraising Challenges**: No centralized platform for donations and campaigns

ReUnion solves these problems with a modern, secure, and user-friendly platform.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Educational institutions lack a reliable, centralized system to manage alumni relationships. After graduation:

- Alumni contact details become outdated or lost
- Career updates and achievements go untracked
- Student-alumni networking opportunities are missed
- Event management becomes fragmented and inefficient
- Fundraising efforts lack coordination and transparency

**The result?** Weakened institutional bonds, reduced alumni engagement, and lost opportunities for current students.
