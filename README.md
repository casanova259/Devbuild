## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Most educational institutions do not have a reliable or centralized system to manage their alumni data.  
After graduation, alumni contact details, career updates, and records are often scattered across WhatsApp groups, emails, or lost entirely.  

This leads to:
- Weak alumniâ€“student connections  
- Missed opportunities for mentorship, internships, and jobs  
- Difficulties in event management and fundraising  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution â€“ Our Project
We built **ReUnion â€“ Revolutionising Alumni Engagement**, a centralized platform where institutions can:  
- Manage alumni data in one secure database  
- Enable alumniâ€“student mentorship and job postings  
- Organize and track alumni events  
- Simplify donations and fundraising  
- Provide multilingual accessibility for inclusivity  
- Use AI-driven recommendations for career guidance
